# BOUML

* Website: https://www.bouml.fr/
* GUI-based editor
* Cross-platform
* Supports class diagrams
* Supports sequence diagrams
* Poor documentation. There is a user manual but it's difficult to find what you're looking for.
* A piece of shit to use. Apparently no keyboard shortcuts. Unintuitive interface. Unhelpful error messages.
* Files don't work well with git.
* Supposedly supports generation of Python 2.2 code but I can't get it to work.
