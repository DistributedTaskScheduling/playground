# plantuml + py2puml

* Website1: http://plantuml.com/
* Website2: https://github.com/ammen99/py-puml-tools (My fork)

* Works only Python Code -> UML, but the generated output is human-readable and can be editted to add associations, other graphics, etc.
* Didn't work out of the box, I had to patch it to properly support multiple packages. But the code is very simple, so we may add more features if needed.
* Text-based.
* Works on Linux and potentially Windows (at least with WSL).
* Supports class diagrams.
* Supports sequence diagrams.
* Works with GIT, since we need to store only the Python Code and can generate the documentation from it.
